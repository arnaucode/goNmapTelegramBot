# goNmapTelegramBot

This is a simple telegram bot, that gets an ip, performs a nmap port scan, and returns the result to the telegram user.

Warning: is not recommended to leave the Bot running, a possible attack to the Bot (and the server where is the Bot running) could be inject command lines outside the nmap
